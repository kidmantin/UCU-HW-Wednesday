# UCU-HW-Wednesday

## First task:
I needed to implement functions to calculate the Levenshtein distance and the Character Error Rate (CER). Modify the CER function to compute the Word Error Rate (WER). 
The solution is in a file called "metrics_task_1.py", although I tried to adhere to the signatures, but in my opinion it was far more logical to write function which would use batches as input, 
so in the task 2 I was using functions which with batches as input. 

Also the time complexity of wer with batches as input is measured in task 2, since I couldn't figure out how to measure space complexity I didn't do it

## Second task:

I retrained a model which showed itself very good on the test data
